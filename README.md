# day-scheduler
This front end application is a simple single day calendar.  It allows the user to type in events for the day and save them to local storage so that they will appear on the page through reloads until the schedule is cleared. 
Using Moment.js, different css changes will take place to the text areas, depending on whether they are past, present, or future events.

The clear button on the bottom of the page allows the user to completely clear the schedule.

## Technologies

This app utilizes JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, Moment.js, Local Storage, jQuery, and Bootstrap.
